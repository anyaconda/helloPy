#--Ch.22. Graphs and trees --
"""
Graphs offer a structure for capturing an incredibly wide diversity of relationships and 
the connections that are formed all over.Â  
i.e. connections between locations 

Vertex/node are represented entities. 
Edges - the connections between nodes.  
i.e. cities and roads.  

Codewise, graphs can have more than 1 representation. 
a)global 
b)focuses on adjacent neighbors 

# --Global - represent a graph as two lists: one list of nodes and one list of edges
Each node will contain information about itself. 
An edge would reference the two nodes.  
If it's a weighted graph, the edges will also store a weight.
